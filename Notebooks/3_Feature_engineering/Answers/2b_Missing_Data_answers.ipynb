    "We can say that the data is missing at random if the probability of being missing is the same only within groups defined by the observed data. An example of this case is when we take a sample from a population. The probability to be included depends on some known property. For example, when placed on a soft surface, a weighing scale may produce more missing values than when placed on a hard surface."

    "Commonly, preparing data for machine learning models often involves several transformations such as imputing missing values, scaling numerical values, or encoding categorical features applied for particular columns. `scikit learn` offers the [`ColumnTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html) class that is used to apply different transformers to columns. This column transformer can be chained with Pipelines along with machine learning model. You can read more about `ColumnTransformer` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html)."
