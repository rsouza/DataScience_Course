    "We saw different techniques and all of them worked reasonably well for making the TS stationary. \n",
    "A very popular technique is to create a model on the TS after differncing, which we will try out next. It is relatively easy to add noise and seasonality back into the predicted residuals in this case. Having performed the trend and seasonality estimation techniques, there can be two situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A strictly stationary series with no dependence among the values. This is the easy case wherein we can model the residuals as white noise. But this is very rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A series with significant dependence among values. In this case we need to use some statistical models like **ARIMA** to forecast the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a brief introduction to ARIMA. I won’t go into the technical details but you should understand these concepts in detail if you wish to apply them more effectively. ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages. The ARIMA forecasting for a stationary time series is nothing but a linear equation (like a linear regression). The predictors depend on the parameters \\\\( (p,d,q)\\\\) of the ARIMA model:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Number of AR (Auto-Regressive) terms (\\\\(p\\\\))**   \n",
    "AR terms are just lags of the dependent variable. For instance, if \\\\( p =  5 \\\\), the predictors for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will be \\\\( x(t-1) \\ldots x(t-5) \\\\).\n",
    "+ **Number of MA (Moving Average) terms (\\\\(q\\\\))**    \n",
    "MA terms are lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation. For instance, if \\\\( q = 5 \\\\), the predictors for \\\\(x(t) \\\\) will be \\\\( e(t-1) \\ldots e(t-5) \\\\) where \\\\( e(i) \\\\) is the difference between the moving average at \\\\(i^{th}\\\\) instant and the actual value.\n",
    "+ **Number of Differences (\\\\(d\\\\))**     \n",
    "These are the numbers of non-seasonal differences, i.e. in this case we took the first order difference. So either we can pass that variable and put \\\\( d=0 \\\\) or pass the original variable and put \\\\(d=1 \\\\). Both will generate the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "An importance concern here is how to determine the value of \\\\(p\\\\) and \\\\(q\\\\). We use two plots to determine these numbers. Lets discuss them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)**   \n",
    "It is a measure of the correlation between the the TS with a lagged version of itself. For instance, at lag 5, ACF would compare the series at the time instant \\\\(t_1 \\ldots t_2\\\\) with the series at instant \\\\(t_1-5 \\ldots t_2-5\\\\) (\\\\(t_1-5\\\\) and \\\\(t_2\\\\) being the end points).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)**    \n",
    "This measures the correlation between the TS with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons. E.g. at lag 5, it will check the correlation but remove the effects already explained by lags 1 to 4.\n",
